---

This repo contains my current codebase and experiments using flutter

## How everything is structured

- `./libs`: Everything under this folder is an adapter to a package
  - `router`: Is the package that abstracts [go_router](https://pub.dev/packages/go_router)
  - `analytics`: Is a package that abstracts google analytics
  - `armor`: Is a package that abstracts the **wrapper that every product must have**
- `./products`: Is the folder that keeps all Products that we have
  - `starter_app`: Just a demo flutter app
- `./shells`: It's the entrypoint of the deployment of the main app of this project
  - `web_portal`: Actually the only one working is the web_portal
